Arithmatic expression
Is a combination of:
operands (values, variables, etc.)
operators ( + - * / %)
that can be evaluated to a value
ex y = x + 5;
or 
students = students + 1;
or even better, use augmented assignment operator, combining the above statement into one by:
students += 1;
Basically, a shortcut to re-assign the same variable

Another thing to keep in mind is operator precedence:
1. Paranthesis ()
2. Exponents
3. multiplication & division
4. addition & subtraction
Just like in normal arithmatics.
