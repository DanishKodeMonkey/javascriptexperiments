//Type conversion is the ability to change
//the datatype of one value to another
//(strings, numbers, booleans)


    /*uncomment for example
//An example use could be as follows
let age = window.prompt("How old are you?");
//we can use the typeoff function to check the type of a variable before:
console.log(typeof age)
//to convert a datatype do the following
age = Number(age)
//and after we can check the variable type again
console.log(typeof age)
//we can now add a number to this input
age+= 1;

console.log("Happy birthday! You are", age, "years old");
    */

/* Another example, uncomment for test
let x;
let y;
let z;

x = Number("3.14")
y = String(3.14);
z = Boolean("")

console.log(x, typeof x);
console.log(y, typeof y);
console.log(z, typeof z);

//extra fact: if a Number is defined as a string, it wil lreturn as NaN in console (Not a Number)
