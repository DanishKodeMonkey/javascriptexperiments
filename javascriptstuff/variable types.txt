There are 3 types of Variables

let 
    stands for lettuce(because it leaves itself behind)
    is the most commonly used variable type
    is limited to within the scope that it is written.

const
    stands for constant, 
    once defined it CANNOT be changed
    useful for variables that you know are never gonna be changed
    adds a bit of data security.
    common naming convention dictates to name all constants in FULL CAPS
