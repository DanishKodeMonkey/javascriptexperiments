//nice, 3 classes. But we have broken a tennet of programmers.
//We have repeated ALOT of code with this.... lets optimise. 
//WITH INHERITENCE!

//So lets create a parent class.
//Creating a parent class is exactly like a child class, 
//but notice each child class now EXTENDS the animal class
//inside the parent class we will place all the code that 
//the child classes have in common.

//Would you look at that! Nothing repeats now! 

//Only the properties and methods that are UNIQUE to the child classes 
//are defined


//And if we create some objects:
const rabbit = new Rabbit();
const fish = new Fish();
const hawk = new Hawk();

//And call the parent class properties!
console.log(rabbit.alive);
hawk.eat();
fish.sleep();
rabbit.run();
